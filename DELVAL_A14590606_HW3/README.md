**Limitations**

As for limitations, I was quite late in finishing this assignment for faults of my own.

I was unable to attend the recent few discussions, and was particularly busy the week of Nov 3rd, missing lecture for a funeral etc.

As a result, I feel that I was not able to make this page resemble the example as much as I could have.

I would've prefered to do more of the aesthetic changes, such as making the pie-bar button look correct, getting the pie title right, and importing correct fonts and colors.

**Usage**

The following resources were used for learning css grid, putting together the synchronized line charts, creating the basic bar and donut charts, creating the toggle button, and accomplishing the onmouseout event.
